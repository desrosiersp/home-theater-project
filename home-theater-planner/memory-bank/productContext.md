# Product Context: Home Theater Planner

## 1. Purpose & Vision

The Home Theater Planner aims to be a comprehensive, user-friendly web application that empowers audio-visual enthusiasts and potentially professionals to design, visualize, and optimize home theater systems. The vision is to demystify the complexities of home theater setup by providing data-driven guidance and intuitive tools.

## 2. Problem Solved

Setting up a home theater correctly involves numerous variables: room dimensions, speaker types and placement, component compatibility, acoustic interactions, and power requirements. Many users struggle with:

- Understanding and applying industry standards (e.g., Dolby Atmos, THX).
- Optimizing speaker placement for their specific room.
- Dealing with room acoustic issues (modes, reflections).
- Ensuring components are well-matched (e.g., receiver power to speaker sensitivity).
- Visualizing the final layout and its performance implications.
  This tool aims to address these challenges by providing a centralized platform for planning and analysis.

## 3. Target Audience & User Needs

- **Home Theater Hobbyists/Enthusiasts:**
  - Need guidance on best practices.
  - Want to experiment with different layouts and components.
  - Seek to understand how their room affects sound quality.
  - Appreciate visual tools to see their setup.
  - May have limited budgets and want to maximize performance for cost.
- **DIY Builders:**
  - Need precise placement information.
  - Benefit from acoustic analysis to plan treatments.
  - Want to ensure component synergy.
- **Potential Future - Professional Installers/Calibrators:**
  - Need efficient tools for planning client setups.
  - Could use advanced analysis and reporting features.
  - Benefit from saving and managing multiple client designs.

## 4. Core User Experience Goals

- **Intuitive & Easy to Use:** Complex calculations and standards should be presented simply.
- **Visual & Interactive:** Users should be able to see their room and speaker layout, and interact with it (e.g., drag & drop).
- **Educational:** The tool should implicitly or explicitly teach users about home theater principles.
- **Actionable Insights:** Provide clear recommendations that users can implement.
- **Customizable:** Allow users to input their specific room details and component choices.
- **Comprehensive:** Cover key aspects from room design to acoustic analysis and component matching.

## 5. Monetization Strategy (Initial Thoughts)

- **Affiliate Links:** Integrate affiliate links for recommended or selected components (e.g., Amazon).
- **Freemium Model (Future):**
  - **Free Tier:** Core functionality, limited number of saved designs, basic features.
  - **Pro/Subscription Tier:** Advanced analysis, unlimited designs, professional reporting features, access to all speaker configurations or specialized tools. (Note: Pro tier terminology currently removed from active development focus).

## 6. Key Differentiators (Aspirational)

- Combination of layout planning, component selection guidance, acoustic analysis, and power calculations in one tool.
- Strong emphasis on industry standards (Dolby Atmos).
- Visual feedback for acoustic phenomena (room modes, FRPs).
- Community aspect for sharing and learning from other builds (future).
